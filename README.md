# linuxshell
this is a college project for linux shell that uses multi-processing to achieve same tasks as the original shell.

it uses C++ ```execvp()``` function to excute the commands and to pass the parameters.

also there is an implentation for shell ```cd``` command.

also there is auto-complete for file names using tab.

## usage
you need to downlad the cpp file and compile it.
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/basselhossam/linuxshell.git
$ g++ -o linuxshell.out linuxshell.cpp
$ ./linuxshell.out
```
